# ML Assignment 2 – Heart Disease Classification

## Problem Statement
The objective of this assignment is to build, evaluate, and deploy multiple machine learning classification models using a Streamlit web application.

## Dataset Description
A synthetic binary classification dataset was generated using sklearn.make_classification to avoid plagiarism.

- Number of instances: 900
- Number of features: 13
- Target variable: HeartDisease (0 = No disease, 1 = Disease)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Naive Bayes (Gaussian)
- Random Forest (Ensemble)
- XGBoost (Ensemble)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- AUC Score
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)

## Streamlit Deployment
The application allows:
- CSV dataset upload
- Model selection dropdown
- Display of evaluation metrics
- Confusion matrix visualization

The app is deployed using Streamlit Community Cloud.
